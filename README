= About

Fluently is a JavaScript toolkit for creating "Fluent Interfaces"[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html].  With Fluently, you can create an object thus:
    var o = Fluently.make(function(define) {
      define('fn1', function() {console.info('called fn1')});
      define('fn2', function() {console.info('called fn2')});
      define.empty('and');
      define.alias('fn3', 'fn1');
    });
to define an object with chained methods, that can be invoked like this:
  o.fn1().fn2()
  o.fn2().fn3()
  o.fn2().and.fn3()

I use it to define the mocks, stubs, and expectations in LzTestKit.

I've extracted a couple of files, from LzTestKit, into the 'examples'
directory.  These don't run on their own, but at least they show the
code in use.

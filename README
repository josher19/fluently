HopKit lets you write functions like this:
  function maker(arg) {
    return HopKit.make(function(define) {
      define('fn1', function() {});
      define('fn2', function() {});
      define.empty('and');
      define.alias('fn3', 'fn1');
    });
  }
to define an object with chained methods that can be invoked like this:
  maker(arg).fn1().fn2()
  maker(arg).fn2().and.fn3()

I use it to define the mocks, stubs, and expectations in LzTestKit.

This is limbo project.  It's undocumented and has a few known bugs.
It's not really ready for 3prime time; I'm releasing it as part of my
2007 house cleaning.

I've extracted a couple of files, from LzTestKit, into the 'examples'
directory.  These don't run on their own, but at least they show the
code in use.
